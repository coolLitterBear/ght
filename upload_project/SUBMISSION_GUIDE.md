# Open Source Project Inclusion Agreement

Before submitting your open source project to this platform, please read this agreement carefully. Your submission constitutes your understanding, agreement, and acceptance of all contents herein.

## I. Core Principles

1.  **Platform Nature**: This platform is a **navigation and showcase website** for open source projects.
2.  **No Code Storage**: We **only retain and display the basic metadata** of your project (such as name, description, links, etc.). We **will never copy, store, or host any source code** of your project. All code remains hosted in its original repository (e.g., GitHub).
3.  **Information Verification**: All information you submit will undergo manual review and verification.

## II. Project Eligibility & Submission Requirements

### Mandatory Requirements
Your project **must** meet **all** of the following conditions to enter the review process:

- **Hosting Platform**: The project must be hosted on **GitHub**.
- **Repository Status**: The repository must be **public**.
- **Open Source License**: The project must include a recognized **open source license file** (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0, GPL).
- **Authentic Information**: All information you submit must be accurate and truthful.

### Recommended Requirements
Meeting the following requirements will **significantly increase the likelihood of approval and display priority** for your project:

- **Live Demo**: The project has a publicly accessible live demo page (e.g., deployed via GitHub Pages).
- **Interactive Experience**: The demo page is **interactive**, not just static documentation.
- **Complete Information Package**: Providing a complete information package including:
  - Project repository link
  - Project live demo link (if available)
  - Bilingual project title (Chinese and English)
  - Bilingual project introduction (Chinese and English)
  - Developer/team identifier (e.g., GitHub username)

## III. Review Process

1.  **Manual Review**: We will access the repository you provided to verify compliance with the requirements stated in Section II.
2.  **Comprehensive Assessment**: Review will be based on a comprehensive assessment of both "Mandatory Requirements" and "Recommended Requirements". **The more recommended requirements met, the higher the likelihood of approval.**
3.  **Final Decision Authority**: This platform reserves the final right to decide whether to include a project and is not obligated to provide detailed reasons for non-approval.

## IV. Your Commitments & Authorization

You hereby promise and guarantee that:

1.  You are the legitimate owner of the project or have obtained explicit authorization from the owner to submit it.
2.  You authorize this platform to permanently and freely display the basic information of your project.
3.  You understand and agree that this platform is completely separate from your project's source code and is not responsible for any code maintenance or security.

## V. Disclaimer

1.  This platform only provides project information display services and **bears no responsibility for the code quality, security, legality, or ongoing maintenance of any included project**.
2.  Users should evaluate and use any included project at their own discretion, bearing all associated risks.
3.  This platform reserves the right to remove any included project at any time for any reason (including but not limited to project invalidation, license changes, receipt of complaints, etc.).
